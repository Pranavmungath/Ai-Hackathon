The rooms were well-maintained, spacious, and elegantly designed. The food at the restaurant was delicious, offering a great mix of local and international flavors. The overall ambiance, service, and attention to detail made my stay truly enjoyable. Highly recommend",

Special thanks to Vahini from the booking team, who went above and beyond by contacting the courier company to ensure my parcel was delivered on time.

We turned up late (6 hours after checkin time) - yet our checkin was delayed by 20 minutes and we had to wait. Entering with a lot of excitement during checkin, we were disappointed to see an empty mini bar. When we went for breakfast too, we had to ask multiple people to get one dish. Nobody really kept track of orders properly and accountability was poor. To top it all, on our second night before we left outside we clearly indicated at the reception to have the room cleaned and came back to the same dirty room. And when we wanted to use the pool, we went to enquire for timings and the receptionist mocked us and didn’t give a clear answer. Extremely disappointing especially when you expect a little too high from the Taj group — I’ve been to major Taj hotels and the experience was way better there. Hope the staff is trained better to treat customers better regardless how they look or dress. A beautiful property being wasted with sub-par service. Sad.",

I will never visit them again !!",

I’m overwhelmed to say the least that this hotel has upheld their standards and exceeded expectations. They provided car and driver to travel to and from the hospital, food and chai to the hospital and all free of cost!!! Management continually checked in on our family and the doctors, to enquire after dad’s tests and condition. Let me also make clear that the hotel has gorgeous rooms, comfortable beds and amenities you’d expect of a luxury hotel. The location, gardens and dining facilities were excellent. My family is forever grateful for the overwhelming hospitality and attention received from Taj Gateway. We will be returning to visit soon.",

Lots of greenery around, perfect location with access to everything within a short drive and extremely friendly staff who were always available to help when needed. The best part of all is this is one of the few pet friendly property in this area. Our dog loved his stay here and enjoyed running around all the lawns. They also cater to dog's dietary needs and provide amenities like dog bed, bowl, etc. will definitely come back with our dog again!",

Not worth the money spent and will not recommend to anyone. - No hot water in the washrooms, had to call them in the middle of the night - Requested fireplace for room heating, but it went down in 15 mins - Electric heater was available but was not working - Spa was advertised in each and every room but was closed for maintenance - Front desk experience was pathetic, we negotiated for discounts, waiting for over 1 hour and ended up paying the full amount close to 1.6 lacs for one night. The location and rooms were good though, the overall hospitality was okayish. Food was good, except for the burnt brownie.",

However, there were a number of issues that make us unlikely to want to go back. To start with, the under floor heating in our room did not work. We were given a noisy electric heater that mitigated the cold, but only in the main room of our cottage. The front sitting room and bathroom were both freezing all the time (and we were told that even if the heating had worked, the bathroom was not heated!?). The breakfast was nice, but the dinner was a standard buffet with no charm. Alcohol was very expensive (e.g. double the price than in other hotels for the same Sula wine). The barman was lovely, but the furniture was tired and the bright lighting killed the atmosphere. We had read they had a snooker table, and we were really looking forward to a game of snooker in the birthplace of the game, but we were very disappointed because the snooker table was in a very bad condition and installed too close to a wall (so much so that it limited where the position of the cue), only one of the cues had a tip, and there were no rests.",

Right front the checkin time, the folks at the desk took their sweet time to check us in. If you want Ice? Gotta call a specific number. If you want water? Gotta call another number. As a customer, I don't want to deal with different numbers just because it's in solid or liquid state! 🙄. Also, early morning I asked them for help with the bags while checking out, but no one bothered to show up and take the bags to the car. I mean, it was literally just 5 meters; but no show - and this was at a time where we were running late to head out to a wedding function. The hotel rooms were kinda decent, but service was way worse than even a 2 star hotel. I have no clue on what basis this place has been rated a 4 star hotel.
