The rooms were well-maintained, spacious, and elegantly designed. The food at the restaurant was delicious, offering a great mix of local and international flavors. The overall ambiance, service, and attention to detail made my stay truly enjoyable. Highly recommend",

We turned up late (6 hours after checkin time) - yet our checkin was delayed by 20 minutes and we had to wait. Entering with a lot of excitement during checkin, we were disappointed to see an empty mini bar. When we went for breakfast too, we had to ask multiple people to get one dish. Nobody really kept track of orders properly and accountability was poor. To top it all, on our second night before we left outside we clearly indicated at the reception to have the room cleaned and came back to the same dirty room. And when we wanted to use the pool, we went to enquire for timings and the receptionist mocked us and didn’t give a clear answer. Extremely disappointing especially when you expect a little too high from the Taj group — I’ve been to major Taj hotels and the experience was way better there. Hope the staff is trained better to treat customers better regardless how they look or dress. A beautiful property being wasted with sub-par service. Sad.",

I will never visit them again !!",

I’m overwhelmed to say the least that this hotel has upheld their standards and exceeded expectations. They provided car and driver to travel to and from the hospital, food and chai to the hospital and all free of cost!!! Management continually checked in on our family and the doctors, to enquire after dad’s tests and condition. Let me also make clear that the hotel has gorgeous rooms, comfortable beds and amenities you’d expect of a luxury hotel. The location, gardens and dining facilities were excellent. My family is forever grateful for the overwhelming hospitality and attention received from Taj Gateway. We will be returning to visit soon.",

Lots of greenery around, perfect location with access to everything within a short drive and extremely friendly staff who were always available to help when needed. The best part of all is this is one of the few pet friendly property in this area. Our dog loved his stay here and enjoyed running around all the lawns. They also cater to dog's dietary needs and provide amenities like dog bed, bowl, etc. will definitely come back with our dog again!",

Not worth the money spent and will not recommend to anyone. - No hot water in the washrooms, had to call them in the middle of the night - Requested fireplace for room heating, but it went down in 15 mins - Electric heater was available but was not working - Spa was advertised in each and every room but was closed for maintenance - Front desk experience was pathetic, we negotiated for discounts, waiting for over 1 hour and ended up paying the full amount close to 1.6 lacs for one night. The location and rooms were good though, the overall hospitality was okayish. Food was good, except for the burnt brownie.",

However, there were a number of issues that make us unlikely to want to go back. To start with, the under floor heating in our room did not work. We were given a noisy electric heater that mitigated the cold, but only in the main room of our cottage. The front sitting room and bathroom were both freezing all the time (and we were told that even if the heating had worked, the bathroom was not heated!?). The breakfast was nice, but the dinner was a standard buffet with no charm. Alcohol was very expensive (e.g. double the price than in other hotels for the same Sula wine). The barman was lovely, but the furniture was tired and the bright lighting killed the atmosphere. We had read they had a snooker table, and we were really looking forward to a game of snooker in the birthplace of the game, but we were very disappointed because the snooker table was in a very bad condition and installed too close to a wall (so much so that it limited where the position of the cue), only one of the cues had a tip, and there were no rests.",

If you want Ice? Gotta call a specific number. If you want water? Gotta call another number. As a customer, I don't want to deal with different numbers just because it's in solid or liquid state! 🙄. Also, early morning I asked them for help with the bags while checking out, but no one bothered to show up and take the bags to the car. I mean, it was literally just 5 meters; but no show - and this was at a time where we were running late to head out to a wedding function. The hotel rooms were kinda decent, but service was way worse than even a 2 star hotel. I have no clue on what basis this place has been rated a 4 star hotel.

Few things which were good, front desk person Abhishek who helped in check-in was very considerate. Housekeeping staff on the floor were very helpful. Breakfast service staff were really very nice keeping a check on guest for their needs. Things that made the experience Ok was room on 7th floor was quite noisy. When i was checking out the lady on the front desk looked like was in a hurry or caught up with some work. Didn't ask about stay when I mentioned that room was noisy rather than asking why or other detail she provided an explanation mam there are pubs nearby that sound . But actually the issue was neighbors and the traffic noise from the road and the some machine noise and not Pub music at all. I didn't say anything to her as her level of engagement and willingness was very evident. I had booked a cab for my further travel. The driver arrived at the hotel and called me after reaching the gate but the security made him to go out without even taking into account that passenger was in the lobby and would have taken 1 min to board . It took another 15 mins for me to get the cab . Advice there are other hotels in the same area I have stayed in Ritz Carlton which has better quitter rooms even admits the chaos down",

                  "comment": "I strongly advise travelers to avoid staying at Taj Bengaluru. My experience here was far below expectations, especially for a property that carries the Taj name. 1. Food and Hygiene Concerns: Four people in my group fell sick after dining at the hotel’s restaurant. This raises serious concerns about the quality and hygiene standards of the food being served. For a property of this stature, such negligence is unacceptable. 2. Unpleasant Odors: The elevators and corridors reek of foul smells, making it extremely unpleasant to move around the property. It gave the impression that cleanliness and upkeep are not prioritized here. 3. Gym Condition: The gym is in an appalling state. The equipment is poorly maintained, and the area is unhygienic and unfit for use. As someone who values fitness facilities while traveling, this was a huge letdown. Overall, the state of the property and services was extremely disappointing. Taj Bengaluru fell far short of the standards one expects from a luxury hotel. I would highly recommend considering other options when staying in the city.",

Great location with easy access off Vittal Malya road in the heart of Bengaluru, the JWM boasts of excellent ambience marked by quiet efficiency. The service is good and the well-trained staff is friendly and attentive without being invasive. The menus were of course specifically tailored to the occasion, but the preparation and presentation were superb. Overall, great experience and can't wait to visit again.",

They were not able to provide the Oberoi service. The room controls via the iPad were trolling - some lights worked with a lag of 5 mins. Lol. If I were staying there for free, I would have given them 3 stars max, only I was paying for all this misery. Consolation was the in-room service and their focaccia bread but, ITC Gardenia is much better.",

I had very well informed the hotel about late check-in + 2 hrs before reaching as well. Yet room was provided around 6.30pm.

The hotel management's explanation was that the room was being cleaned. However, I have been staying here for several days, and the room is only cleaned in the morning. Furthermore, the morning cleaning had already been completed. While the cleaners perform basic tidying, they often neglect tasks such as refilling the water and cleaning the kettle.",

Their service, allocation of rooms, housekeeping and internet were really really really slow. We requested 3 rooms on a single floor. They requested some time and came back with no rooms available after 30 40 mins so we have to take whatever given. We requested our luggage to deliver to our rooms to which they agreed but nothing came up after 30 mins so we have to pick them up again from the reception area. We checked into the rooms and no AC was working at all. We called the reception 3 times and went in person to them for sending someone for ac repair. It took almost 2.5 hours after checking for an AC to work. Being in twin-sharing rooms, their washroom door should be locked but their latch was not working at all. Same situation was in all 3 rooms that we stayed in. They provide very limited internet service. Being in IT park where most of your guests are from business background, slow internet is not an option. They provide 2 devices per person in a room to access the internet. I booked the room for 2 persons but 1 cancelled out so I should get access for 4 devices logically but received only for 2 devices. If you need high speed internet, you need to buy extra. When we provided the negative feedback at the checkout time, they tried to cover it up with no logical reasons.",

The location was quite calm and good, making it a comfortable stay away from the city’s hustle. The hotel’s ambience was nice, and the food quality was also good. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, but the size was quite small, fitting just one or two people comfortably. For work-related stays, it was decent, and the pricing was quite reasonable for the services offered. One of the highlights was the excellent room service and the friendly, respectful staff. A special mention to Khushi, who handled everything smoothly and ensured a hassle-free experience. Overall, a good budget-friendly option for short work trips!",

The reception staff was highly uncooperative. Despite pre-booking a deluxe bedroom, we were provided with a room that had two separate single beds. After multiple attempts to resolve this issue with the reception, their final solution was simply joining the beds, which was done very poorly. To make matters worse, they did not even provide a proper double-bed blanket. Additionally, the hotel and rooms had a foul smell, making the stay quite uncomfortable. The overall experience was not worth the money. I would strongly advise others to think twice before choosing Ginger.",

By the way if you look at the reviews, you can understand why it has such a high rating but I’m giving low rate, there hardly any foreigner staying here and review. I don’t see any foreigner during my stay here and I came here because my regular hotel was fully booked. Ginger was a bit more expensive than the one across the road but the standard are too huge that no way to compare. It is good if I compare to other local favorite hotel in this area such as astra. However, still need a lot improvement on hygiene and overall guest comfort, see my photos to understand why I said so. It’s too close to traffic with lots of noice at night.",

Despite advertising itself as a 5-star hotel, the service and quality are nowhere near that level. The room was mediocre at best, but the customer service was appalling. When I requested plates and cutlery, I was given cheap plastic ones—unacceptable for a hotel claiming to be 5-star. When I called to question this, I was told that’s their standard now. After being dissatisfied with both the room and service, I asked to check out early, only to be told I’d still be charged for the next day as a penalty fee. What truly stunned me was their response when I needed basic medicine. They said they didn’t have any, and if I wanted it from a nearby pharmacy, I’d have to pay for a chauffeur-driven car to get it. This kind of service is unheard of in a 5-star hotel, especially when they claim to offer medical assistance. Overall, Zuri is all about overcharging while delivering subpar service. I’ve experienced better hospitality at budget hotels. I strongly recommend avoiding Zuri—save your money and stay somewhere that actually values its guests.",
